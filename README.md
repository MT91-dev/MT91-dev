👋 Hello, my name is Mohammad and I am currently part of the June Cohort bootcamp for web development at Lighthouse Labs!
I have completed my Undergrad in Environmental Engineering and I have close to 6 years of experience working in chemical analytics as a data analyst and in the Engineering Consulting field as a Project Manager.
👀 Asides from my interests in programming, development and apps, I like to spend time at the gym, listening to all kinds of music, video games, playing guitar, catching the sought after animes, and being a complete nerd.
🌱 In the bootcamp thus far, I have learned JavaScript, HTML and CSS and React, but I plan to expand my horizons as I become more involved in this space.
