👋 Hello, I’m @MT91-dev and I am new to the space of development! I am just starting out my programming endeavour and will be part of the June cohort for Lighthouse Labs!
I have completed my Undergrad in Environmental Engineering and I have close to 6 years of experience working in chemical analytics as a data analyst and in the Engineering Consulting field as a Project Manager.
👀 Asides from my interests in programming, development and apps, I like to spend time at the gym, listening to all kinds of music, video games, playing guitar, catching the sought after animes, and being a complete nerd.
🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript, HTML and CSS, but I play to expand my horizons as I become more involved in this space. Luckily, I am excited to be learning Node.js and React.js as part of my upcoming bootcamp with Lighthouse Labs.
💞️ In terms of collaborations, at the moment I do not have anything in my arsenal, however, I have some ideas that I am hoping I can bring to life and meet exciting individuals who want to be part of that journey with me.
