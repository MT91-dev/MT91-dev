ğŸ‘‹ I have completed my Undergrad in Environmental Engineering and I have close to 6 years of experience working in chemical analytics as a data analyst and in the Engineering Consulting field as a Project Manager.
ğŸ‘€ Asides from my interests in programming, development and apps, I like to spend time at the gym, listening to all kinds of music, video games, playing guitar, catching the sought after animes, and being a complete nerd.
ğŸŒ± Here's some cool snapshot.
